      <h1>Hi there! üëã</h1>

      <div class="intro-text">
        <h3>My name is Alexander, I'm 30 years old, and am currently living in Ghent together with my lovely
          girlfriend Lisa and our cat Mariette. <br>
          In 2018 I descided to make a carreerswitch into IT, and started studying computer science at Hogeschool VIVES
          in
          Kortrijk. <br>
          The opportunity that Switchfully and UZ Brussel gave me are the cherry on top of a very interesting,
          educational,
          and exciting experience. <br>
          I can't wait to meet my fellow students and teachers, and together with you guys I'd like to make this a
          wonderful
          journey!
        </h3>

            <h1>Cycling üö≤</h1>
            <p>Meeting friends over a long ride in the weekend, enjoying the beautiful
              scenery, and ending the ride tired but satisfied gives me lots of energy. And cycling doesn't have to be
              recreational
              only, it can be practical too! Some time ago, my girlfriend and I descided to sell both our
              cars, got a
              <a href="https://www.larryvsharry.com/" target="_blank">Bullitt cargobike</a>, and never looked back.

            <p>When I was a little boy the music microbe bit me, hard. Since then playing and listening to music had
              been
              a passion in
              life which I still enjoy. </p>

            <p>"A picture is worth a thousand words." I enjoy telling a story through a photograph. When we're out and
              about you can usually spot me with a camera. Be sure to check out the <a href="blog.html">"Blog"</a> for
              some tips in order to take a great picture!</p>

            <p>Playing boardgames is a real stressreliever! Having fun with friends and family while building
