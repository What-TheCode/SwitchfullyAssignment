            <h2>Choose your object</h2>
            <p>
              A typical photograph is made up of two basic elements: the subject and the environment in which it’s
              located.
              The subject’s position against the background, as well as the background’s own position, are just as
              important as the subject.<br>
              A good composition should have a clear main subject.

            <h2>Use the rule of thirds</h2>
            <p>
              The rule of thirds is one of most well-known compositional rules in photography, and describes a basic
              compositional structure of a picture. The frame can be split in 9 segments by using 3 vertical and 3
              horizontal lines.
              The idea behind this concept is to place the subject on one of the 4 intersections of these lines.
              Although this is a widley used concpt, this is not a requirement to take a good picture in every
              situation!

            <h2>Look for great lighting</h2>
            <p>
              In order to take a great picture lighting is one of the most important things to keep in mind.
              One of the best times to take a picture is the golden hour. This is a timeframe just after en before
              sunset,
              and
              results in a golden-hued scene which makes for a warm picture.

            <h2>Use the correct exposure (exposure triangle)</h2>
            <p>
            <section>
              There are three basics to master a good exposure:
            </section>
            <section>
              <strong>Aperture</strong> can be defined by the opening in the lens through wich the light passes. A
              bigger opening lets in more light, and vice versa. Aperture can also add dimention and perspective to
              your photo by
              controlling the depth of field.
            </section>
            <section>
              <strong>Shutter speeds</strong> is the amount of time the shutter is open. This is measured in seconds.
              You can use a fast shutter speed to freeze movement, or use a slow one to take a blurred shot. When
              shooting
              hendheld, a shutterspeed of more than 1/60th of a second is recommended in order to take a crisp shot.
            </section>
            <section>
              And last but not least <strong>ISO</strong>. ISO basically is a measure of the camera's sensor ability
              to
              capture light. In poor lighting the ISO can be raised to capture more light, at the cost of a granier
              image.

            <section>
              These three are in close relationship to each other; when you adjust one of them, you have to consider
              adjusting the others to get the desired result. The automatic mode on the camera takes care of all these
              for you, but you pay the price of not getting the picture to look the way you want them to look.
